We found that the best neighborhood is **Marshal-Shadeland**. To get this conclusion, we first looked at park ratings. Larger playgrounds gave
them higher ratings, as well as if they are handicap accessible. The ratings per park  were then added together to make it per 
neighborhood. This data was then compared to the Pittsburgh Service Providers per neighborhood, creating a greater emphasis on the amount
of Verizon in each neighborhood to determine the score. Better service allows the user to have a more enjoyable experience playing
Pokemon-Go and a greater park score means more pokemon and poke-stops. Finally, if the neighborhood has more traffic signs per acre, it is 
less likely that someone would get hit by a car, making it a safer neighborhood to play Pokemon Go. These three were averaged to determine 
Marshal-Shadeland is the best neighborhood to play Pokemon-Go.
